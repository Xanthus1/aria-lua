# Aria LUA

By Xanthus

This script for Bizhawk adds some additional settings and modes for Aria of Sorrow 
to introduce some new novel gameplay elements. I created this as the backbone for 
an eventual Twitch integration I'm working on, but you can play only using this 
script to enable the modes below.

Requires Bizhawk v2.9

- NES Mode
    - You can't change direction in midair, unless you double jump, or use Flying Armor
    - New movement tech: Slingshot. You can jump out of backdash while holding the opposite direction to keep momentum in the air.
- SPRINT Mode
    - Hold attack to move faster while on the ground
    - You can also do this in water, there's a minor graphical glitch though.
- CHAOS Mode
    - Weapon is randomized after each kill.
    - Red soul is randomized each time you attempt to use a red soul.
- Random CMDs
    - This script will activate random effects over time (similar to other games with Twitch integration)
    - You can see the list of commands in a drop-down.

note: this script is currently hardcoded to default button inputs,
    - if you change config this wont work as expected
